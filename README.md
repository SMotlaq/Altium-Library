# Welcome to my Altium Designer library repository!

Over the past 5 years, I have created and maintained this library to help streamline my PCB design workflow. The library contains a variety of useful components

While I have made every effort to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the components in this library, it is possible that there may be some mistakes or inaccuracies. Please review the components carefully before using them in your designs.

The library is compatible with Altium Designer version 21.0 and later. To use the library, simply download the zip file, extract the contents, and place the folders in the appropriate locations on your computer.

I hope you find this library useful in your PCB design endeavors! If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to reach out to me through [Telegram account](https://t.me/S_Motlaq) or E-mail: pilot.motlaq@gmail.com
